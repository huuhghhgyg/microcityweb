# 3.2 Editing Scripts
MicroCity Web applications are written by <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html" target="_blank">Lua Script</a>. In addition to being familiar with Lua's syntax, users also need to be proficient in using a script editor.

## Script Editor
The Script Editor integrated is based on <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace" target="_blank">Ace</a>, which is easy to use and has many features.

Here we briefly introduce the button panel and message bar, the script editor and the scene canvas will be discussed in details in later chapters: [3.2 Editing Scripts](3.2_editing_scripts.md), [3.3 Running Scripts](3.3_running_scripts.md) and [3.4 Navigating Scenes](3.4_navigating_scenes.md).

## Keyboard Shortcuts


## Code Generation
In order not to block the script editor and scene canvas, the message bar is usually folded. You can enlarge it when you **left-click** it. The message bar displays various information as shown in the figure below. When you **right-click** it, it prompts a console cursor. In this mode, you can enter commands to control the execution of Lua scripts. This is especially useful when [debugging scripts](3.3_running_scripts.md).
