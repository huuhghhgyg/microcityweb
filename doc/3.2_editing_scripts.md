# 3.2 Editing Scripts
MicroCity Web applications are written by <a href="https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html" target="_blank">Lua Script</a>. In addition to being familiar with Lua's syntax, users also need to be proficient in using a script editor.

## Script Editor
The Script Editor integrated is based on <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace" target="_blank">Ace</a>, which is easy to use and has many features. The following figure shows the graphics and symbols that often appear in the editor window. The "Break Point" and "Current Line" are used when [debugging the script](3.3_running_scripts.md).
