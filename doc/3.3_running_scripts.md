# 3.3 Running Scripts
MicroCity Web provides a compact and versatile user interface.

## Run, Pause and Stop Scripts
The user interface of MicroCity Web is divided into four parts: **Button Panel**, **Script Editor**, **Scene Canvas** and **Message Bar** as shown in the figure below:

Here we briefly introduce the button panel and message bar, the script editor and the scene canvas will be discussed in details in later chapters: [3.2 Editing Scripts](3.2_editing_scripts.md), [3.3 Running Scripts](3.3_running_scripts.md) and [3.4 Navigating Scenes](3.4_navigating_scenes.md).

## Logging


## Debugging
In order not to block the script editor and scene canvas, the message bar is usually folded. You can enlarge it when you **left-click** it. The message bar displays various information as shown in the figure below. When you **right-click** it, it prompts a console cursor. In this mode, you can enter commands to control the execution of Lua scripts. This is especially useful when [debugging scripts](3.3_running_scripts.md).
