# 2.1 Rolling A Cube
This tutorial is to guide you in using the MicroCity Web User Interface.

## Running the Script
When you open MicroCity Web for the first time, a sample script will be automatically loaded into the script editor on the left. Click the **Run**![play](../img/play.svg) button, a "hello, there!" message will appear in the message bar below, and a rolling cube will appear in the scene canvas on the right. You can also use the buttons to **pause**![pause](../img/pause.svg) or **stop**![stop](../img/stop.svg) the cube, or click the **code**![code](../img/code.svg)  button to hide the script editor and expand the scene canvas. For more information on running scripts please refer to [3.2 Running Scripts](3.2_running_scripts.md).

## Editing the Script
The MicroCity script uses the [Lua language](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.4/manual.html). Please read the comments carefully to understand the behavior of the sample script and refer to [4.3 Scene and Object](4.3_scene_and_object.md) for details on control scenarios and object functions. If you want to see something different, add the following code before `obj:setrot(x, y, z)`:
```
z = z + 0.1
```
This code will change the way the cube rotates. You can **save**![save](../img/save.svg) the new code locally or **publish**![publish](../img/publish.svg) it online, and MicroCity will generate a URL similar to https://microcity.gitee.io/#xxxxxx. Others can access the MicroCity application you created or modify your code through this URL.


## Navigating the Scene
If you want to observe the scene from different angles and orientations, you can use the mouse to navigate the scene canvas. Press and hold the **left mouse button** in a blank space of the scene canvas and drag. The scene camera will rotate in the opposite direction of mouse movement. If you hold down the **right mouse button** and drag, and the scene camera will translate in the opposite direction of mouse movement. If the left mouse button **selects an object** and drags it, the scene camera will center on the object and rotate in the opposite direction of mouse movement. In addition, sliding the **mouse wheel** can move the scene camera forward and backward. For more information please refer to [3.4 Navigating Scenes](3.4_navigating_scenes.md)
