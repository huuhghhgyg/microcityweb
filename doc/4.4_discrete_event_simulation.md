# 4.4 Discrete Event Simulation
In simulation, events need to be randomly generated and scheduled, so the random number and coroutine functions in Lua have been improved.

## Random Number Generation
The probability distribution of random numbers has been expanded, but the traditional usage is still maintained.

<a id='math.randomseed'> math.randomseed (x, [, disttab]) </a>

Return a seed according to the integer parameters x and the optional table of disttab. The options in disttab:
- dist: Probability distribution, one of "normal", "exponential", "poisson" and "uniform". Default is "uniform".
- mu: Mean or expected value. Default is 1.
- sigma: Standard deviation (only applicable for normal distribution). Default is 1.

<a id='math.random'> math.random ([seed|m [, n]]) </a>
When called without arguments, returns a uniform real number in the range [0,1). When called with an integer number m, returns a uniform integer in the range [1, m]. When called with two integer numbers m and n, returns a uniform integer in the range [m, n].
<br>When called with a seed returned from math.randomseed, returns a number follow the distribution specified by the seed. This usage can be rewritten to seed:random(). A example is shown below:
```
local seed = math.randomseed(1, {dist = "normal", mu = 5, sigma = 3})
for i = 1, 10 do
    print(seed:random())
end
```

## Event Scheduling


coroutine.queue(rt, f|co [, arg1, ···]): 在协程队列中等待
rt: 	相对当前队列时间，>=0
f/co:	函数或者协程

coroutine.qtime(): 得到当前队列时间
