# 1.1 What MicroCity can Do
The objective of MicroCity Web is to provide an **easy and fast** tool for logistics modelling which can **run anywhere**.

## A Data Analysis Appliance 
Through programmable scripts and a rich 2D/3D scene library, MicroCity Web can be used to analysis and vividly display a variety of data.
